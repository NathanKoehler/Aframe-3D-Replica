This project was created as a part of the aframe assignment for LMC 2700,
whose objective was to create a 3D environment from a 2-dimensional media.
To run, I would ensure that the proper dependencies are installed through 
npm install, and then use the command http-server to create instances of the aframe scene. Performance is somewhat of an issue due to the large number of assets that are loaded in, so it may be keen to be patient with the program. I've also included a video and images of the 3D scene in case there are difficulties running the program this way. A difficulty with importing glb and obj files has caused the github page to be an inadequate way of hosting.
